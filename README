Running Tests
==================
Pluma has several test that can be run after compilation. Run them by issueing "make check". However there are a couple of requirements that need to be satisfied before they will pass.

* You need the gsettings schemas installed for some tests to be able to run.
* You need to mount sftp://localhost/ with gvfs-mount for one test to pass.

If test fail and you have setup the above correctly then please file a bug report as described below.

How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the MATE bug tracking system:

  https://github.com/mate-desktop/pluma/issues 
  
You will need to create an account for yourself.

In the bug report please include:

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - What version of X
   - What version of the gtk+, glib and mate libraries
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the
  crash occurred.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but is not
  necessary. If you do send a stack trace, and the error is an X error,
  it will be more useful if the stack trace is produced running the test
  program with the --sync command line option.
