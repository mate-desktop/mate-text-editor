## This is the plugins directory for pluma. If you want to write a plugin, you have to put the plugin folder here. Each plugin folder must contain a README file having a brief description of the plugin. See the other folders for better understanding.

**NOTE:** As of now, all Python 2 plugins (external tools, indent lines, python console, quick open and snippets) are disabled until they are ported to Python 3 (see PR [#425](https://github.com/mate-desktop/pluma/pull/425)).
